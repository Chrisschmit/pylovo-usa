Grid Generation for Classification
===================================

For the grid generation two steps are performed:

.. autofunction:: raw_data.import_building_data.import_buildings_for_multiple_plz

and

.. autofunction:: classification.database_communication.perform_classification_tasks_for_multiple_plz.generate_grid_for_multiple_plz

These functions perform the same tasks described in :doc:`../../grid_generation/index` for multiple PLZ.
Check these out to find out more about the processes of building import and grid generation.
Check out the :doc:`../../visualisation/qgis/qgis` to inspect the resulting grids on a map.

*****

Step 1: Configure the classification
====================================
Open the file :code:`config_classification.py`. Set up the classification by giving it a classification version,
a description and a region, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    CLASSIFICATION_VERSION = 1
    VERSION_COMMENT = "set sample with inspected building quality"
    CLASSIFICATION_REGION = 'Bayern'

A classification version is a unique identifier for your classification and can only be used once. The version comment can be used
to describe the settings used in the classification version.
For the region either choose one of the federal states of Germany

.. code-block:: python

    REGION_DICT = {1: 'Schleswig-Hohlstein',
               2: 'Hamburg',
               3: 'Niedersachsen',
               4: 'Bremen',
               5: 'Nordrhein-Westfalen',
               6: 'Hessen',
               7: 'Rheinland-Pfalz',
               8: 'Baden-Württemberg',
               9: 'Bayern',
               10: 'Saarland',
               11: 'Berlin',
               12: 'Brandenburg',
               13: 'Mecklenburg-Vorpommern',
               14: 'Sachsen',
               15: 'Sachsen-Anhalt',
               16: 'Thüringen',
               }

| that are listed as values in the dictionary or use :code:`'Germany'` for the entire country.
| Make sure that you have the building data for the chosen region.

Once you run the classification the constants that you have set will be saved
in the database table :code:`classification_version`.

Step 2: Calculate the Data for Clustering
==========================================
| To generate the grids, calculate the grid parameters and filter erroneous grids run the file :code:`prepare_data_for_clustering.py`.

Threshold values for filtering can be set in :code:`clustering.config_clustering`.

The processes run here are explained in :doc:`../classification_steps/sampling`,
:doc:`../classification_steps/grid_generation_for_classification`,
:doc:`../classification_steps/parameters` and
:doc:`../classification_steps/filter_grids`.

Step 3: Inspect sampling results (optional)
===========================================
In the notebook :code:`examples_sampling.analyse_sampling_results` the samples drawn in the region of classification
are visualised on a map.

    :alt: Default view

The distribution of samples within Regiostar 7 classes is shown.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/anz_samples.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

Step 4: Inspect grid generation results (optional)
==================================================
The generated grids can be visualised in QGIS (all grids)

.. image:: ../../images/visualisation/qgis6.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

or using plotting functions (individual grids). For more details see :doc:`../../visualisation/index`

Step 5: Inspect grid parameters (optional)
==========================================
In the package :code:`examples_parameters_per_plz` the parameters of the grids can be analysed. In the notebook
:code:`analyse_clustering_parameters` a matrix of scatter plots called pairplot is shown to gain an overview of the data.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/pairplot.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

The grids can be sorted by a parameter to show grids with specific characteristics.

The notebook :code:`vsw_analysis` focuses on the 'Verbrauchersummenwiderstand' (resistance in the network) that can be
an indicator for voltage drop of branches.


Step 6: Choose parameters for clustering
=========================================

To fast track step 6  you can call :code:`get_parameters_for_clustering`. The optimal parameters for clustering
are calculated and outputed in the console. They should then be inserted in :code:`clustering.config_clustering` as explained below.

The package :code:`examples_correlation_and_factor_analysis` has the tools to choose the parameters for clustering.
In this work, it is proposed to choose the clustering parameters according to the factor analysis.

The notebook :code:`1_0_factor_analysis` guides you through the process of finding the number of and the parameters
that are mathematically optimal for clustering. The resulting parameters are listed at the end of the document.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/factor_analysis.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

The proposed parameters do not need to be taken for clustering. Other preferences and considerations can be taken into account.
Additional information like the explained variance of the factors or components can be found in the notebook
:code:`1_1_explained variance_eigen_decomposition`.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/eigendecomposition.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

The correlation matrix and clustermap are plotted in the notebook :code:`1_2_correlation_matrix`

After you have choosen the parameters set them in :code:`clustering.config_clustering`, like:

.. code-block:: python

    # set clustering parameters
    param1 = 'no_branches'
    param2 = 'avg_trafo_dis'
    param3 = 'max_no_of_households_of_a_branch'
    param4 = 'no_house_connections_per_branch'
    LIST_OF_CLUSTERING_PARAMETERS = [param1, param2, param3, param4]

Step 7: Choose number of clusters
=================================
To fast track step 6  you can call :code:`get_no_clusters_for_clustering`. The optimal no_clusters for clustering
are calculated and outputed in the console. They should then be inserted in :code:`clustering.config_clustering` as explained below.

In the package :code:`examples_indices` you will find two indices for finding the optimal number of clusters:

* Calinski Harabasz Index or CH Index and
* Davies Bouldin Index or DB Index

It is recommended to choose the number of clusters with the CH index from the notebook
:code:`1_CH_index`. The DB Index can be used for reference.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/ch_index.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

Again according to the goals of clustering with orientation of the index results set the numbers of clusters
for the cluster algorithms in :code:`clustering.config_clustering`:

.. code-block:: python

    # set number of clusters
    N_CLUSTERS_KMEDOID = 5
    N_CLUSTERS_KMEANS = 5
    N_CLUSTERS_GMM = 4  # refers to gmm tied

Step 8: Clustering results
===========================
You now have the option to investigate the results in :code:`examples_clustering`. For each of the clusterin algorithms

* kmeans,
* kmedoids and
* gmm tied

there are two notebooks. In the first one, the representative grids  are presented. Their clustering parameters can be
compared with the radar plot. The representative grids are plotted individually.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/radar_plot_kmeans.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

In the second notebook is more concerned with the overall clusters and the distribution of clusters over the regiostar
classes are plotted.

.. image:: ../../images/classification/distribution_regio5_clusters.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Default view

To view the clustering results in QGIS run :code:`apply_clustering_for_QGIS_visualisation` and open QGIS.
There you have the option to identify the clusters of the grids by color
